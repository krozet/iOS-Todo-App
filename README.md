# Todo App
Todo App created using Swift for iOS

# Description
Todo App is a simple app that allows the user to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task is given a name and a priority rating, and is displayed to the user on the Tasks screen.

App creator: Keawa Rozet  
Credit: This app is largely based off of a tutorial provided by Gary Tokman. In following this tutorial, much like how I do in class, I learned a great deal about iOS development.  

# How it Works
  The app uses Core Data to store persisting information and goes through the processes of fetching the data, editing it, and saving it.
